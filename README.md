# Transcriptional Adaptation

Transcriptional adaptation (TA) is a type of genetic compensation whereby the effects of harmful loss of function (LoF) mutations are mitigated by the upregulation of genes with sequence similarity, or gene paralogs (a review of genetic compensation can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006780)). Recent [work by El-Brolosy and colleagues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6707827/) has identified this mechanism occurring in zebrafish and mice, however TA has not been validated as a protective mechanism in humans.

This project will utilise data from the GTEx consortium to assess whether there is evidence of TA occurring in healthy human populations.
